# Fake News detection from Kaggle Dataset

This repository contains models trained for fake news detection from the dataset of https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data. The models were trained using Fine-Tuning as transfer learning technique with different ways to do Fine-Tuning from pretrained models in Hugging Face Transformers https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training

* Transformers Trainer: Fine-Tuning of DistilBERT model	
* PyTorch Native: Fine-Tuning model BERT
* Tensorflow with Keras: Fine-Tuning of model RoBERTa

This project was carried out as a final project for the master's degree in Big Data and Data Science - International University of Valencia VIU.
